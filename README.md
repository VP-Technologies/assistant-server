# assistant-server
A backend for the VP Technologies assistant, running NodeJS and using Postgres as a DB.

## Setup
In order to use the server, you need to install Postgres on your local machine, and startup the Postgres server.

### One step startup
For your convenience, there is an included script that will download all dependencies, start the necessary databases, and start the server all for you. Run this script using the following command (for Mac and Linux only)

```sh assistant```

That's it! You now have a fully functional backend up and running, ready to use!
